# The 'Request Unblock' service is a Rust app that provides a web form
# that users can use to submit a request to unblock a URL. Requests are
# saved in a Redis database that the services can pull from.

name: Request Unblock

# Only run this Workflow for pull requests on branches or pushes to 'main'.
# Limited to commits that make changes to the service's directory in the repo.
